# xhsi

A version of XHSI with control panel(s)

You must first install the XHSI plugin from Sourceforge

Then run:

    java -jar xhsi.jar

The configuration is in

    XHSI > Preferences > Commander

Try the 4-Column and 5-Column internal autopilot panels, and then take a look at CMD.config

Most of the testing has been done with the "Evenblade with Garmin 530 for X-Plane 10.303" on
X-Plane 10.32 and Java version 1.7.0_45
